        <h2 id="_cr_hyper">Creating hyperlinks</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
        <p>Basic HTML familiarity, as covered in Getting started with HTML. HTML text formatting, as covered in HTML
          text fundamentals.
          Objective: To learn how to implement a hyperlink effectively, and link multiple files together.
          What is a hyperlink?
          Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web
          since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other
          documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost
          any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to
          another web address (URL).
        </p>
        <p>Note: A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text documents, video and audio files, or anything
          else that lives on the Web. If the web browser doesn't know how to display or handle the file, it will ask you
          if you want to open the file (in which case the duty of opening or handling the file is passed to a suitable
          native app on the device) or download the file (in which case you can try to deal with it later on).
        </p>
        <p>For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only to multiple news stories, but also
          different areas of the site (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and more.
        <h3>Anatomy of a link</h3>
        <p>A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href
            attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
        <code>I'm creating a link to</code>
        <code>&lta href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"&gt;the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;</code>
        <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>This gives us the following result:</p>
        <p>I'm creating a link to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US">the Mozilla homepage.</a></p>

        <h2 id="_add_supp">Adding supporting information with the title attribute</h2>
        <p>Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title contains additional information about
          the link, such as which kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></p>
        <code>I'm creating a link to</code>
        <code>&lta href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"</code>
        <code>title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's mission and how to contribute"&gt;</code>
        <code>the Mozilla homepage&lt;/a&gt;</code>
        <p><code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
        <p>This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays the title as a tooltip.</p>
