      <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
      <p> Web Development is a software engineering discipline that involves the development of websites and web services. The variety of work in Web Development is huge, it can range from creating a basic static web page to complex interactive web apps, including enterprise-scale applications and application programming interfaces. However, there is much more that is relevant when developing for the web. For example, the design and content of a web page, web servers and networking as well as security aspects have to be considered.

      <h2>Why Web Development?</h2>
      <p>The internet has disrupted our economy and society. The technologies we use on a daily basis will keep evolving, thus in the future Web Development will be even more important than it is today. Browsers are getting more powerful day by day, today they can even be used as whole operating systems (e.g. ChromeOS). Recent Web Development toolkits already allow you to create native apps on any device. Learning how Web Development works will provide you with powerful and versatile programming skills. These enable you to design websites, build applications, and to visualize data and make it accessible for users. Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and other domains often require modern web-based interfaces to connect with the user to provide value. Therefore, having knowledge of Web Development will be an asset for you!
